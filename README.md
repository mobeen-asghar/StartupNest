# 🚀 StartupNest

**StartupNest** is a sleek, futuristic platform for entrepreneurs to **brainstorm, plan, and visualize startup ideas**. Built as a SaaS-style MVP tool, it provides a rich UI for simulating startup validation workflows, integrating **AI-driven insights** (mocked), visual planning, and roadmap features—all without requiring a backend.

> 🔒 **Note**: All data is currently static or stored using `localStorage`. You can easily extend the app by connecting your own backend or APIs.

## 🎯 Purpose

StartupNest is designed as a **client-side MVP** to help early-stage entrepreneurs:
- Explore and organize startup ideas.
- Simulate startup validation with preloaded data and AI-style feedback.
- Build roadmaps and export plans.
- Manage settings and preferences—fully offline.

The app focuses on speed, usability, and visual appeal, with full customization potential.

## 🔧 APIs and Data Flow

StartupNest runs entirely in the browser using `localStorage` for data persistence. There are **no external API calls** or backend services by default.

### 🛂 Authentication (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Login & Register**: Users are stored in `localStorage` with basic credentials.
- **Session State**: Determined by `currentUser` in localStorage.
- **Profile Update**: Updates reflected in `localStorage` for persistence.

### 💡 Startup Ideas (`startupIdeas.ts`)
- Ideas are preloaded from a static data file.
- Filtered in real-time by keyword and industry.
- Likes are saved per user in `localStorage`.

### 🛣️ Roadmap Milestones (`RoadmapTab.tsx`)
- Predefined milestones managed via component state.
- Can be added, removed, or updated during a session.
- PDF export supported—but milestone state isn’t saved persistently yet.

### ⚙️ User Settings (`SettingsPage.tsx`)
- Profile and notification settings managed locally.
- Preferences like theme and alerts are saved to `localStorage`.
- Users can export their data as a JSON backup.

### 🌙 Theme Preference
- Supports light/dark mode, remembered across sessions.
- Stored using `localStorage`.

> 💡 While everything works client-side, StartupNest can be enhanced to connect with real-time databases, authentication providers, or analytics tools.
